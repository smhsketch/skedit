# skedit
A WIP, cross-platform, lightweight text editor built in Tk

# dependencies

* `python3`
* `tcl`
* `tk`
* `python-tk`

# installation

since skedit is in a very early state, there is no installer/package you can run.
however, it is very easy to build skedit manually.

ensure you have all of skedit's dependencies installed before continuing.

## windows

* clone the repository to your computer. `git clone github.com/smhsketch/skedit`
* copy the `skeditFiles` folder to `C:/Program Files/`
* run `dist/skedit.exe`

## mac / linux

* clone the repository to your computer. `git clone github.com/smhsketch/skedit`
* copy the `skeditFiles` folder to `/usr/share/`
* copy the `skedit` (NOT `skedit.py`) script to `/usr/bin/` and `sudo chmod +x` the script to ensure it can run
* run the `skedit` command with your program launcher or terminal.
