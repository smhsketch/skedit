# skedit
A WIP, cross-platform, lightweight text editor built in Tk

# dependencies

if you want to run a raw, uncompiled instance of skedit, it depends on

* `python3`
* `tcl`
* `tk`
* `python-tk`

however, there are no dependencies to run a `.exe` or compiled *nix script of skedit.

# installation

download `skedit` (*nix) or `skedit.exe` (Windows) from the [releases](https://github.com/smhsketch/skedit/releases) tab. Source code is also available.
